Today, I bought a Google Chromecast for a friend of mine. The leaflet promises setup in three easy steps:  <ul> <li> connect to power and TV (via HDMI)   =&gt; ok, no problem</li> <li> switch the source on your TV to the chromecast   =&gt; ok, the splash screen asks you to open chromecast.com/setup to complete the setup </li> <li> open chromecast.com/setup    =&gt; doesn't work at all - apparently, the chromecast fails to perform a DNS lookup for itself (sic!) </li> </ul> The only reliable way to get it to work seems to be to install the Google Home app and use that to setup the Chromecast - which is okay, but the leaflet and the Chromecast itself explicitly recommend doing it the other way. It's a shame that Google fails to provide correct information regarding such a basic thing.
