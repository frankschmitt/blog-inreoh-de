KeePass is an amazing tool for storing passwords in a secure manner, but syncing password databases across multiple devices can be somewhat challenging.<br /><br />For several years, I've used<br />- MiniKeepass on iOS<br />- KeePass + Mono on OS X<br />- Dropbox for syncing<br /><br />and was quite content with this combination.<br /><br />But since KeePass is not very well integrated in OS X, I decided to switch to KeePass X. This seemed ok at first glance, but recently I noticed that several entries I had created in MiniKeepass were missing in KeePassX ðŸ˜•. I then tried KeePassXC, with the same result.<br /><br />I still haven't found the root cause - it might be a manifestation of h<a href="ttps://github.com/MiniKeePass/MiniKeePass/issues/136">ttps://github.com/MiniKeePass/MiniKeePass/issues/136</a> or a similar (more recent) bug in MiniKeepass, but I haven't found time to investigate this.<br /><br />For the time being, I switched from KeePassX / KeePassXC to <a href="https://mstarke.github.io/MacPass/">MacPass.</a><br />It's also Open Source, and it seems to be able to handle alle entries created by MiniKeepass.
