Ever wanted to pin a certain app to a fixed screen in Spaces? Easily done:<br /><ul><li>switch to the space you want to use (must have been created by you - automatically created ones apparently won't work)</li><li>right-click the icon for your app in the Dock</li><li>select "Assign to" -&gt; "This desktop"</li></ul>
