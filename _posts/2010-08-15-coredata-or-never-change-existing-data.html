Ok, so sometimes I'm a little bit naive (esp. regarding SW development):<br />Added a new entity to my CoreData data model, build&amp;run - hups.<br />App crashes, the console contains<br /><br />"The model used to open the store is incompatible with the one used to create the store"<br /><br />Googling around for the error message quickly brought the sholution - delete app + data from the iPhone simulator, and re-build it. Everything is fine again :-)
