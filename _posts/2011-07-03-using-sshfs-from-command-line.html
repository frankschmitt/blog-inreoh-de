Until now, I've only ever used SSHfs (SSH file system on top of MacFuse) via the GUI, but using the command line is much quicker:<br /><br /><code>sshfs user@server:/remotedirectory/ /mountpath -oping_diskarb,volname=<volume name="" for="" finder=""><br /><br /></volume></code> although I'm a little disappointed that ~ apparently doesn't work for the remote dir :-(
