When trying to build Riak on Mac OS X, you might encounter a failure when make is trying to build the dependencies:<br /><br />ERROR: 'get-deps' failed while processing <path_to_dependency><br /></path_to_dependency><br /><br />The cause (at least for me) was that accessing github via the git:// protocol doesn't work from our corporate network.<br /><br />Workaround: build at home, where the git: protocol isn't blocked by the firewall.
