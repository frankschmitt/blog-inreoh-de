Tracing system calls on Mac OS X is incredibly simple with dtruss (which is just a shell script that wraps a fancy configuration for dtrace):<br /><br />&nbsp; <b>sudo dtruss -f ~/scratch/bla.sh</b><br /><b><br /></b>The -f instructs dtruss to also trace system calls for forked child processes (which I usually want).
