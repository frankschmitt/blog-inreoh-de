<h2>Motivation</h2>Since my son asked me to develop a simple 3D game for him, and I've always wanted to do something like that, I started playing around with 3D game engines.<br /><br />I've chosen GamePlay3D&nbsp;<a href="http://gameplay3d.org/">http://gameplay3d.org</a>, because<br /><br /><ul><li>it's Open Source (this is my main reason for not using Unity)</li><li>it's Cross-Platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Android - I'm especially interested in Mac OS X and iOS)</li><li>unlike some other Open Source engines, it seems to be actively developed</li><li>it contains a 3D engine, support for mouse/keyboard/gamepad/touchscreen, and sound support</li></ul><div><br /></div><h2>Getting started</h2><div>Getting started with GamePlay3D is easy - just download it, open the XCode workspace, compile the samples and play around with them.</div><div><br /></div><h2>Creating a new project</h2><div>Playing around with the samples is nice, but creating your own project is much more interesting. To create a new project:</div><div><ul><li>open a Terminal</li><li>cd <gameplay directory="" installation=""></gameplay></li><li>./newproject.sh</li></ul><div>and enter the required information in the wizard. This will create a new XCode project (btw, this will also create a new Visual Studio project) - open the project, compile &amp; run it, and you'll see a cube rotating in space. Woot!</div></div>
