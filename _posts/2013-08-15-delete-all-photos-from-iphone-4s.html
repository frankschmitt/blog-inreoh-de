When ordering my new iPhone 4S about 2 years ago, I thought 16 GB would surely be enough - boy, what a mistake.<br /><br />Since my photo collection (&gt; 2600 photos and a couple dozen videos) was about 9.5 GB in size, I decided to remove all of them and re-import only the most important ones. Sadly, the photo app doesn't have a "Remove all" button, but as usual, the Internet provided a quick solution:<br /><ul><li>connect iPhone to Mac </li><li>open Preview</li><li>File -&gt; Import from iPhone</li><li>Select all (Cmd+A)</li><li>click the "Delete" button in the lower left corner</li></ul><br />(see https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3777283?start=0&amp;tstart=0 for alternative approaches)<br /><br />
